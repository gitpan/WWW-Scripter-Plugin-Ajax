Revision history for WWW::Scripter::Plugin::Ajax

0.05    8 November, 2009
        Fixed to work with LWP 5.833

0.04    4 October, 2009
        Fixed a really nasty bug:  Sending any data  via  the  send()
        method via  HTTP  would tickle an incompatibility  with  LWP/
        Protocol/http.pm  that would result in an  LWP-generated  500
        error (Not a SCALAR reference). (We now stringify the content
        before passing it to LWP.) Thanks to Steven Nikkel for report-
        ing the error.

      • Infinite or external redirects are  now  turned  into  errors
        (NETWORK_ERRs) if async is false. In any case, they now cause
        all information pertaining to the response  to  be  discarded.
      • getResponseHeader and  getAllResponseHeaders  now produce the
        correct type of error  (INVALID_STATE_ERR)  when the state is
        UNSENT or OPENED.
      • As a temporary hack to get someone’s code working,  this  mod-
        ule adds textContent to XML::DOM::Lite::Node,  if it does not
        already exist.

0.02    15 August, 2009
        Fixed to work  with  WWW::Scripter::Plugin::JavaScript  0.002.
        The test script was relying on a bug in that module.

0.01    5 April, 2009
        First version. Just a renamed version of the Mech plugin with
        a few tweaks.


Revision history for WWW::Mechanize::Plugin::Ajax

0.05    16 October, 2008
        Fixed to work with  LWP  5.818,  which has a heart attack when
        an HTTP header’s value is an object that happens indirectly to
        reference a code reference.

0.04    15 October, 2008
        No new features; simply updated to work with LWP 5.815

0.03    9 September, 2008
        • The errors produced when the URL passed to open is from the
          wrong site/port/etc. are now DOMException objects.
        • The open method now clears the responseText and the
          request headers.
        • The send method now raises a readystatechange event on send-
          ing (without changing the readyState)  and for the ‘loading’
          state (3).
        • The setRequestHeader method now dies when called at a time
          other than between open and send.
        • setRequestHeader now throws a syntax error when the argu-
          ments do not conform to HTTP syntax.
        • The send method no longer runs scripts on HTML pages that
          it fetches.
        • setRequestHeader now ignores certain HTTP headers for the
          sake of security and HTTP compliancy.
        • The send method now dies when the readyState is not OPENED
          or when it is called recursively.
        • Assigning null to onreadystatechange no longer causes warn-
          ings and errors during event dispatch.
        • The argument to the send method is now ignored for GET and
          HEAD requests.

0.02    19 August, 2008
        • Relative URIs are now supported.
        • URIs are now checked to see whether they originate from the
          same server  (and port and  scheme)  as  the  current  page.
        • Fake cookies (created by setRequestHeader) are no longer
          clobbered when there are real cookies.
        • The event methods addEventListener, removeEventListener and
          dispatchEvent have been added.
        • There are now constants for the readyState
          (XMLHttpRequest.UNSENT etc.).
        • Non-standard HTTP method names are no longer folded to
          uppercase.
        • The ‘open’ method now dies if the method name is not a
          valid HTTP token or if it is CONNECT,  TRACE or  TRACK
          (case-tolerant).
        • The fragment part (#...) of a URI is now stripped.
        • The ‘open’ method now dies if the URL’s scheme is not
          supported.
        • Username and password are now gleaned from the URL if pres-
          ent and if the corresponding  args  to  open  are  omitted.
        • The username and password info no  longer  leaks  from  one
          object to the next. (The send method used to set the creden-
          tials for all XHR objects that didn’t have any.)
