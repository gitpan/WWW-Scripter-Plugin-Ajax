  site/port/etc. are now DOMException objects.
• The open method now clears the responseText and the request headers.
• The send method now raises a  readystatechange  event on  sending
  (without changing the readyState) and for the ‘loading’ state (3).
• The setRequestHeader method now dies when called at a time other
  than between open and send.
• setRequestHeader now throws a syntax error when the arguments do not
  conform to HTTP syntax.
• The send method no longer runs scripts on HTML pages that
  it fetches.
• setRequestHeader now ignores certain HTTP headers for the sake of
  security and HTTP compliancy.
• The send method now dies when the readyState is not OPENED or when
  it is called recursively.

  errors during event dispatch.
• The argument to the send method is now ignored for GET and
