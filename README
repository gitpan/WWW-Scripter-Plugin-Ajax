RECENT CHANGES

0.03
----
• Infinite  or  external  redirects  are  now  detected  and  handled
  correctly.
• getResponseHeader  and  getAllResponseHeaders  now produce the  cor-
  rect type of error  (INVALID_STATE_ERR)  when the state  is  UNSENT
  or OPENED.
• As a temporary hack to get someone’s code working, this module adds
  textContent  to XML::DOM::Lite::Node,  if it does not already exist.

0.02
----
Fixed to work with WWW::Scripter::Plugin::JavaScript 0.002.  The test
script was relying on a bug in that module.

WWW::Mechanize::Plugin::Ajax 0.03

• The errors produced when the URL passed to open is from the wrong
  site/port/etc. are now DOMException objects.
• The open method now clears the responseText and the request headers.
• The send method now raises a  readystatechange  event on  sending
  (without changing the readyState) and for the ‘loading’ state (3).
• The setRequestHeader method now dies when called at a time other
  than between open and send.
• setRequestHeader now throws a syntax error when the arguments do not
  conform to HTTP syntax.
• The send method no longer runs scripts on HTML pages that
  it fetches.
• setRequestHeader now ignores certain HTTP headers for the sake of
  security and HTTP compliancy.
• The send method now dies when the readyState is not OPENED or when
  it is called recursively.
• Assigning null to onreadystatechange no longer causes warnings and
  errors during event dispatch.
• The argument to the send method is now ignored for GET and
  HEAD requests.
