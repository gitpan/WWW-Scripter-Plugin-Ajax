  for synchronous requests.
• The abort method now actually aborts when called from a  readystate-

  is active.

0.05
----
Fixed to work with LWP 5.833

0.04
----
Fixed a really nasty bug:  Sending any data via the send() method via
HTTP would tickle an incompatibility with  LWP/Protocol/http.pm  that
would result in an  LWP-generated 500 error.  Thanks to Steven Nikkel
for reporting the error.
