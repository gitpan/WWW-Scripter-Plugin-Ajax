WWW::Scripter::Plugin::Ajax, version 0.04 (alpha)

Plugin for WWW::Scripter that provides the XMLHttpRequest object.


RECENT CHANGES

0.04
----
Fixed a really nasty bug:  Sending any data via the send() method via
HTTP would tickle an incompatibility with  LWP/Protocol/http.pm  that
would result in an  LWP-generated 500 error.  Thanks to Steven Nikkel
for reporting the error.

0.03
----
• Infinite  or  external  redirects  are  now  detected  and  handled
  correctly.
• getResponseHeader  and  getAllResponseHeaders  now produce the  cor-
  rect type of error  (INVALID_STATE_ERR)  when the state  is  UNSENT
  or OPENED.
• As a temporary hack to get someone’s code working, this module adds
  textContent  to XML::DOM::Lite::Node,  if it does not already exist.

0.02
----
Fixed to work with WWW::Scripter::Plugin::JavaScript 0.002.  The test
script was relying on a bug in that module.
